## About

Dive into the cutting-edge intersection of DevOps and AI with AutoCoder. This project guides you to build a reusable GitHub Action that leverages Generative AI to auto-generate code. You will create workflows, interact with OpenAI using scripts, enforce security standards, and eventually convert your project to a reusable GitHub Action to share with others or show off in your portfolio.
